# Mitsubishi Heavy Industries WF-RAC WLAN module — external interface reference

**Audience:** anyone writing software that talks to an MHI WF-RAC WLAN module
over the network, and anyone building a CNS/SPI replacement (ESP32, ESP8266)
who wants to know what the stock module actually does on the bus.

**Purpose:** interoperability. This describes the interfaces a client needs in
order to talk to the module correctly - nothing here is a guide to modifying,
reflashing or circumventing anything in it, and the sections that touch write
paths say so explicitly.

**Direction of travel:** outside in. Network → HTTP → `airconStat` blob →
CNS/SPI frame. The module's own internals appear only where they explain a
behaviour you can observe from outside; the raw evidence is in
[Appendix A](#appendix-a--bridge-mcu-internals-provenance).

**Reading the confidence tags.** Every non-obvious claim carries one. Do not
silently upgrade them.

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[HW]` | Observed on real hardware (SRK35ZS-WF, firmware `WF-RAC-HTTPS 025/200`) |
| `[FW]` | Read out of a firmware image (module or bridge MCU), static analysis |
| `[APP]` | Read out of the official Smart M-Air app (version 1.4.009) |
| `[EXT]` | External project documentation, chiefly [MHI-AC-Trace](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Trace) / [MHI-AC-Ctrl](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl) |
| `[UR]` | Reported by a user on hardware I do not have. One report unless it says otherwise |
| `[INF]` | Inference from the above. Plausible, **not** tested |

## 1. What the module is

The WF-RAC module is **two processors**, not one:

```
        ┌──────────────────────── WF-RAC module ───────────────────────┐
 Wi-Fi  │  Realtek RTL8710C (Ameba-Z2)        Renesas RL78             │   CNS
════════╪══ FreeRTOS, mbedTLS 2.4.0  ══UART══ protocol bridge  ════════╪══════ AC
 HTTPS  │  HTTP/MQTT server, TLS,             airconStat ⇄ SPI frames  │  SPI   main
 :51443 │  base64, OTA, Wi-Fi                 (acts as the remote      │        board
        │  "M" firmware                        control) "C" firmware   │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- The **Realtek** side (`M` firmware, e.g. `WCBN4612L_M_029.bin`) is network
  plumbing. It base64-decodes the `airconStat` blob and hands the raw bytes to
  the RL78. **It never interprets a single status bit.** `[FW]`
- The **RL78** side (`C` firmware, e.g. `WF-RAC-HTTPS_C_200`) is the
  interesting one: it is the **CNS/SPI remote control**, i.e. exactly the role
  an ESP32 running MHI-AC-Ctrl takes over when you unplug the module. It
  receives MOSI frames, sends MISO frames, and translates both directions into
  the `airconStat` blob. `[FW]`

**Consequence for ESP32 developers:** the WF-RAC network protocol is not a
separate protocol. It is the MHI CNS/SPI frame wrapped in base64 and JSON, with
a fixed set of bits stripped out. Everything MHI-AC-Trace documents about
`DB0…DB14` applies, with a known offset (§4).

**Consequence for network developers:** anything the AC's main board knows but
the CNS bus doesn't carry is unreachable, and anything the bridge chooses not to
forward is unreachable — but the request channel is generic and largely unused
by the official app (§5).

---

## 2. Layer 1 — discovery and the local HTTP API

### 2.1 Finding the device

- **mDNS service `_beaver._tcp`** `[FW]` `[HW]`
  - instance name: MAC address without colons, lower case (`348e89c5a137`)
  - host: `<mac>.local`
  - port: `51443`
  - TXT record: empty
- No UDP broadcast protocol, no discovery endpoint.

### 2.2 Transport

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Port | `51443` (all firmware branches) `[HW]` |
| Scheme | `https://` on the `WF-RAC-HTTPS` and `WCBN4612L` branches, plain `http://` on the older `WF-RAC` branch `[HW]` |
| Method | `POST` only |
| Path | `/beaver/command/<commandName>` |
| Body | JSON, see below |

**TLS is ancient.** The module links mbedTLS 2.4.0 (2016) `[FW]`. Modern clients
fail the handshake with `SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE` unless you drop the
security level and allow legacy renegotiation. The certificate is self-signed
and its CN does not match the IP, so hostname verification must be off. If you
do not know the branch, probe: try one scheme, fall back to the other.

Some modules answer with a **valid JSON body under the wrong `Content-Type`**
(`text/plain`) `[HW]`. Parse the body regardless of the declared type, and parse
it on non-2xx statuses too — error responses carry useful JSON.

### 2.3 Request envelope

Every request, without exception:

```json
{
  "apiVer": "1.0",
  "command": "getAirconStat",
  "deviceId": "<your client id, free-form string>",
  "operatorId": "<your operator UUID>",
  "timestamp": 1754400000,
  "contents": { "airconId": "348e89c5a137" }
}
```

**All five envelope fields are mandatory and validated before the command is
dispatched.** `[FW]` The parser reads them in this order and returns an error on
the first failure, so a missing envelope field looks exactly like a malformed
request:

| Field | JSON type | Checked how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | string | present, non-empty; then dispatched |
| `apiVer` | string | present, non-empty — **the value is never compared.** The literal `"1.0"` exists in the image only for *emitting* responses. Send anything non-empty and it passes |
| `operatorId` | string | present, non-empty here; `setAirconStat` additionally validates it against the stored accounts (§2.5) |
| `deviceId` | string | present, non-empty; logged (`deviceId_value=%s`) and passed on to the command handler |
| `timestamp` | number | present **and non-zero** |
| `contents` | object | required by every handler except `getDeviceInfo` |

**`timestamp` sets the module's clock.** `[FW]` The parsed 64-bit value is
written straight into the module's time global. The module has no RTC, so *your
client is its time source* — which is where account `expires` values and the
MQTT `aggTm` stamp come from. Send a real Unix timestamp in seconds; sending
garbage will skew the device's notion of time.

Responses carry `command`, `apiVer: "1.0"`, `result` and `contents`. `[FW]`

### 2.4 Endpoints

Seven handlers are registered in the module firmware; there are no others. `[FW]`

| Command | `contents` required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getDeviceInfo` | *(none — body is not evaluated at all)* `[FW]` | Always answers `airconId`, `macAddress`, `apMode`. Use this to bootstrap: it is the only call that works before you know the `airconId`. |
| `getAirconStat` | `airconId` | Returns the current state blob |
| `setAirconStat` | `airconId`, `airconStat` (base64) | Returns the *new* state blob |
| `updateAccountInfo` | `accountId`, `airconId`, `remote` (0/1), `timezone` | Registers your operator id on the device |
| `deleteAccountInfo` | `accountId`, `airconId` | Frees a slot |
| `setNetworkInfo` | `ssid`, `netPass` | Wi-Fi provisioning (AP mode) `[FW]` |
| `updateFirmware` | *(not documented here)* | Firmware updating is the app's job — see §8 for why you do not want to drive this yourself |

Additionally, the MQTT (cloud) side knows `setTopicId`, `putAirconStat` and
`reportAirconStat`. These are **not** reachable locally. `[FW]`

### 2.5 The two hard rules

Both are enforced in firmware and both produce confusing failures if you get
them wrong.

1. **`airconId` is mandatory in the body of every relevant call.** `[FW]`
   `json_command_getAirconStat` and `…putAirconStat` check, in order: `contents`
   is non-NULL → `contents` is a JSON object → `get_string(contents,"airconId")`
   is non-NULL and non-empty. Any failure aborts before anything happens. Newer
   firmware answers `HTTP 400` with `result: 2`. Older firmware happens to
   tolerate its absence, which is why some clients omit it and "work".

2. **`setAirconStat` additionally validates `operatorId`.** `[FW]` It is compared
   against the up-to-four accounts stored in flash (table stride `0x68`) and
   against the literal string `aws`. An unknown `operatorId` aborts the handler.
   So: call `updateAccountInfo` once with your own UUID before you try to
   *write* anything. Reading works without registration.

   The `aws` escape hatch is real: `operatorId: "aws"` was accepted for
   `setAirconStat` on a `WF-RAC-HTTPS 025` device without registering anything
   `[HW]`. Handy for one-off diagnostics — it consumes no account slot — but
   register properly for anything permanent.

   `remoteList` does **not** let you discover the registered ids: a device with
   `numOfAccount: 2` returned `["", "", "", ""]`. `[HW]` It lists only accounts
   registered with `remote: 1`, and emits a single `null` when none qualify;
   `numOfAccount` counts every occupied slot. `[FW]` A list that looks empty next
   to a non-zero count is therefore normal, not a fault.

   Four account slots exist, and a device paired with several phones can be
   full. `[FW]` Nothing about them is automatic: entries never expire, and a
   full table refuses the **new** client rather than displacing an existing
   one, so registering cannot push anyone out. The only way a slot is ever
   freed is `deleteAccountInfo`. Re-registering an id you already hold costs
   nothing and takes no second slot — it updates the entry in place.

   A fifth client can still read everything; it is writing that a full table
   denies it.

### 2.6 Rate limiting

The module is single-threaded about connections and says so: the firmware
contains `429 Too Many Requests`, `Connection rate exceeded`,
`device lock timeout: %d` and `send_message_unlock_semaphore_timer`. `[FW]`

**Practical rule, confirmed in the field:** one connection at a time, at least
**1 second** between requests, per device. `[HW]` Violating it produces dropouts
that look like a flaky network.

### 2.7 The 60-second write lock — the one that catches everyone

An applied `setAirconStat` grants its sender **60 seconds of exclusive write
access**. Everyone else is refused for the duration. `[FW]` The check sits at the
head of the handler:

```
if (last_writer && expires >= now && strcmp(deviceId, last_writer) != 0)
        abort;                          /* answers result 1 or 12 */
...                                     /* otherwise apply, then: */
expires     = now + 60;
last_writer = deviceId;
```

Four things follow, and each of them has bitten a client:

- **It keys on `deviceId`, not on `operatorId`.** Two phones sharing one
  Smart M-Air account lock each other out exactly as an unrelated client would.
- **Reads are free.** `getAirconStat` neither takes nor tests the lock.
- **A read-only `setAirconStat` still takes it.** A status request for
  operation data (§5.3) applies nothing, and renews the lock all the same. Poll
  it once a minute and you own the unit permanently — the official app included
  will be unable to control it. Leave at least one full lock duration free in
  every cycle.
- **A refused write is invisible afterwards.** Neither `expires` nor
  `updatedBy` moves on the collision path, so there is no way to find out that
  somebody was locked out — only that somebody got through.

`expires` in the status response is that deadline, and it can be compared
against your own clock directly: the module has no RTC and takes its time from
the `timestamp` of every request it receives (§2.3), so your own request sets
the clock its answer is measured against. A rise in `expires` between two polls
means a write happened in between — yours if you sent one, someone else's if
you did not. That is the only reliable way to notice another client, and it
only works while you let the lock lapse often enough for them to get a write
in.

**The result codes do not identify this case.** `[FW]` The handler's internal
return value is mapped to the JSON `result` through one small table
(`-1 → 2`, `0 → 0`, `1 → 1`, `2 → 12`, `3 → 11`), and a bridge-MCU error on the
normal path arrives at the very same values as the collision path does. So
`1`/`11`/`12` mean "refused", not "refused by someone else's lock". Treat them
as a reason to check `expires` and retry once, not as a diagnosis.

### 2.8 Response fields (`getAirconStat` / `setAirconStat`)

In the order the firmware emits them: `[FW]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `airconId` | MAC-derived device id |
| `airconStat` | **base64 state blob — the actual payload, see §3** |
| `logStat` | bit 2 of an internal flag byte |
| `updatedBy` | `deviceId` of the last successful writer — but reported as the literal `local` whenever that writer's account carries `remote: 0`, which every locally paired client does `[FW]` |
| `expires` | when the last writer's 60-second exclusive write access lapses (§2.7) — **not** an account expiry |
| `autoHeating` | frost-protection flag (see §6.3) |
| `firmType` | hard-coded in the image, e.g. `WCBN4612L` |
| `timezone` | |
| `highTemp`, `lowTemp` | `0xFF` is emitted as JSON `null`; in practice constant `"AB"`/`"66"` (see §6.3) |
| `wireless.firmVer` | `%03d`-formatted counter, e.g. `025` |
| `mcu.firmVer` | bridge MCU version, e.g. `200` |
| `remoteList` | registered accounts |
| `numOfAccount` | |

`updatedBy` does **not** distinguish IR remote from Wi-Fi changes — it is
constant `local` in all recordings. `[HW]`

### 2.9 The complete field inventory

The `WCBN4612L` module image contains exactly these JSON key strings and no
others `[FW]`. **This is closed for that branch only.** The `WF-RAC` and
`WF-RAC-HTTPS` images are encrypted and could not be inventoried — and a live
`WF-RAC-HTTPS 025` device returns two fields that are *not* in this list,
`ledStat` (integer) and `mcu` (object, `{"firmVer": "200"}`) `[HW]`.
`ledStat` is the unit's own "LED ON" display-light toggle from the app's
Option Settings screen (gated by the `led_light` capability), not a Wi-Fi
module status flag — a constant `1` just means the setting has never been
switched off `[APP]`. Expect
per-branch additions:

`command`, `apiVer`, `operatorId`, `deviceId`, `timestamp`, `contents`,
`result`, `airconId`, `airconStat`, `accountId`, `macAddress`, `apMode`,
`logStat`, `updatedBy`, `expires`, `autoHeating`, `firmType`, `highTemp`,
`lowTemp`, `wireless`, `firmVer`, `remoteList`, `numOfAccount`, `timezone`,
`remote`, `firmUrl`, `cksum`, `ssid`, `netPass`, `topicId`, `aggTm`.

Four of them have a **known transport but an unverified effect** — the module
demonstrably reads and forwards them, but nobody has confirmed that writing them
changes anything on the AC. Treat them as unknown, not as features:

| Field | What is certain | What is not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `logStat` (request) | read on `setAirconStat`, value forced below 2, stored in an internal flag bit, echoed in the response `[FW]` | what the bit switches on |
| `autoHeating`, `highTemp`, `lowTemp` (request) | placed into the UART frame header to the bridge MCU, at header bytes `[3]` bit 0, `[4]`, `[5]` `[FW]` | whether the AC acts on them. Responses are constant `0` / `"AB"` / `"66"` on every device measured, and the official app never writes them locally (§6.3) |
| `deviceId` (value) | mandatory, logged, handed to the command handler `[FW]` | whether any handler evaluates it, or whether it only has to be present |
| `timezone` | stored per account, echoed back `[FW]` | what the module uses it for — `expires` formatting and `aggTm` are the obvious candidates, neither traced |

---

## 3. Layer 2 — the `airconStat` blob

Base64. Decoded, it is **two independent blocks back to back**, each with its
own CRC16: `[APP]` `[FW]`

```
┌─────────────── COMMAND block ──────────────┬─────────────── RECEIVE block ──────────────┐
│ 18 B state │ 1 B segCount │ segCount×4 B │ 2 B CRC │ 18 B state │ 1 B segCount │ … │ 2 B CRC │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **COMMAND block** = what you want the AC to do (and, in a device response, an
  echo of the last command it accepted). This is the block the bridge MCU
  translates into MISO frames.
- **RECEIVE block** = what the AC currently *is*. This is the block you parse.

### 3.1 Locating the RECEIVE block

The COMMAND block is variable-length, so:

```python
seg_count      = data[18]                 # segment count of the COMMAND block
receive_start  = seg_count * 4 + 21       # 18 state + 1 count + n*4 + 2 CRC
state          = data[receive_start : receive_start + 18]
rx_seg_count   = data[receive_start + 18]
segments       = data[receive_start + 19 : receive_start + 19 + rx_seg_count*4]
```

### 3.2 CRC16

CRC16-CCITT, appended **little-endian** to each block: `[APP]`

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Polynomial | `0x1021` |
| Init | `0xFFFF` |
| Reflect in / out | no / no |
| Final XOR | none |
| Covers | the block's own bytes only (state + count + segments) |

The bridge MCU verifies the COMMAND block's CRC before doing anything with it.
`[FW]`

### 3.3 The "nothing to send" sentinel

When it has no variable data to transmit, the official app appends
`[0x01, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]` — segment count `1`, then one segment whose
code byte is `0xFF`. `[APP]` The bridge treats code `0xFF` as "no request" and
skips the whole request path. `[FW]` Use this as your default trailer.

---

## 4. Layer 3 — the 18-byte state block **is** the CNS/SPI frame

This is the key insight for anyone coming from the ESP32 side.

The bridge MCU copies the state block straight out of the MOSI frame: `[FW]`

```
state[0..9]   = MOSI raw byte  1..10
state[10..17] = MOSI raw byte 20..27
```

Since the MHI frame is `SB0 SB1 SB2 DB0 DB1 …`, that gives:

### 4.1 Byte map

| `state[i]` | SPI | Contents | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `SB1` | `0x80 \| ModelNr` — the signature byte doubles as a model id, read it as `state[0] & 0x7F` | `[FW]` `[HW]` |
| `1` | `SB2` | constant `0x04`, no known use | `[FW]` |
| `2` | `DB0` | power / mode / up-down swing | `[HW]` |
| `3` | `DB1` | fan speed / vane position | `[HW]` |
| `4` | `DB2` | setpoint | `[HW]` |
| `5` | `DB3` | room temperature in use, `(raw−61)/4` °C | `[EXT]` `[HW]` |
| `6` | `DB4` | error code | `[HW]` |
| `7` | `DB5` | bit `0x10` echoes `command[8]` from the last command frame — not a device state (§5.3) | `[HW]` |
| `8` | `DB6` | operation-data type/echo; bit `0x08` = "cool/hot judge" off | `[HW]` |
| `9` | `DB7` | bit `0x02` = **compressor running** (see §4.6) | `[HW]` |
| `10` | raw 20 | `bit0` occupancy/`Vacant`, `bit2` self-clean reset | `[HW]` |
| `11` | raw 21 | left-right vane position (low 5 bits) | `[HW]` |
| `12` | raw 22 | 3D-auto/`Entrust`, LR-vane enable, self-clean flags — **forced to `1` on legacy-signature units, see §6.7** | `[HW]` `[FW]` |
| `13`–`14` | raw 23–24 | unknown | — |
| `15` | raw 25 | `bit0` self-clean operation (see §6.4) | `[HW]` |
| `16`–`17` | raw 26–27 | unknown | — |

`state[10..17]` live **beyond** the classic 20-byte frame. WF-RAC-capable units
send extended frames; this is where left/right vanes and 3D-auto are carried.
MHI-AC-Ctrl reaches part of the same area as its `DB16`/`DB17`. `[EXT]`

### 4.2 Decoding the state block (read path)

```python
Operation      = (state[2] & 0x03) == 1              # power on
OperationMode  = {0x08:'auto', 0x10:'cool', 0x0C:'dry', 0x04:'fan', 0x00:'heat'}[state[2] & 0x3C]
SwingUD_on     = (state[2] & 0xC0) == 0x40
AirFlow        = {0x07:'auto', 0x00:1, 0x01:2, 0x02:3, 0x06:4}[state[3] & 0x0F]
VaneUD         = (state[3] & 0xF0) >> 4              # 0..3 -> position 1..4, ignored if swinging
PresetTemp     = state[4] / 2.0                      # °C
IndoorTemp_raw = state[5]                            # see §4.5 — but prefer the pushed segment
ErrorCode      = state[6]                            # see §4.4
CoolHotJudge   = (state[8] & 0x08) == 0
Vacant         = (state[10] & 0x01) != 0
VaneLR         = (state[11] & 0x1F) + 1              # not reported if (state[12] & 0x03) == 1, see §6.7
Entrust3D      = (state[12] & 0x0C) == 0x04
```

Mode bit layout is `DB0[4:2]` and the fan bits are `DB1[1:0]`, exactly as in the
SPI documentation `[EXT]`; the tables above are the WF-RAC-observed values `[HW]`.

### 4.3 Building the COMMAND block (write path) — and the set-bit trap

The COMMAND block is copied byte-for-byte into the MISO frame with the same
offset: `command[i] → MISO raw byte i+1`, so `command[2] → DB0`, and so on. `[FW]`

On the MHI bus, **writing a field means setting its accompanying set-bit**. A
value alone is ignored. Those set-bits are:

| Field | Value bits | Set-bit | In `command[]` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power | `DB0[0]` | `DB0[1]` | `command[2] \|= 0x02` (+`0x01` for on) |
| Mode | `DB0[4:2]` | `DB0[5]` | `command[2] \|= 0x20` |
| Vane up/down swing | `DB0[6]` | `DB0[7]` | `command[2] \|= 0x80` |
| Vane up/down position | `DB1[5:4]` | `DB1[7]` | `command[3] \|= 0x80` |
| Fan | `DB1[1:0]` | `DB1[3]` | `command[3] \|= 0x08` |
| Setpoint | `DB2[6:0]` | `DB2[7]` | `command[4] = temp*2 \| 0x80` |
| Room temperature | `DB3[7:0]` | *(none)* | `command[5]`, `0xFF` = leave internal sensor |

This is why the WF-RAC command tables look "off by a constant" compared with the
receive tables — e.g. mode `auto` is `0x20` when writing and `0x08` when reading.
The extra bits *are* the set-bits.

A complete, safe command block: start from
`[0,0,0,0,0,0xFF,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`, set only the fields you want to
change, append the sentinel trailer of §3.3, CRC it, then append a RECEIVE block
built the same way (the official app sends both; the device ignores the receive
half). `[APP]`

**Never leave `command[5]` at anything other than `0xFF` unless you mean it** —
see §5.5.

### 4.4 Error code (`state[6]`)

```python
code = state[6] & 0x7F
if state[6] & 0x80:  label = f"M{code:02d}"   # indoor/self-diagnosis family
elif code == 0:      label = "00"             # no error
else:                label = f"E{code}"       # E-family
```

Bit 7 selects the family, and the bit-7 test must come **before** the
zero test. `[APP]` Getting this wrong is a well-worn bug: a naive
implementation makes the `E` branch dead code.

### 4.6 `state[9] & 0x02` — compressor demand

Not documented anywhere else. It carries the distinction between *powered on*
and *actually calling for the compressor* — the AC reports `hvac_action:
cooling` either way, and this bit costs nothing to read, since it rides along
in every ordinary status poll with no operation-data request needed.

Correlated against operation-data code `0x11` (compressor frequency) across a
multi-day recorder history of two indoor units on one outdoor unit `[HW]`:

| Situation | `state[9] & 0x02` | Code `0x11` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit calling for compressor | 1 | > 0 Hz |
| Unit satisfied, sibling unit also idle | 0 | 0.0 Hz |
| Unit satisfied, **sibling still calling** | 0 | > 0 Hz |

Both directions are covered. Where no sibling was demanding, the bit and the
frequency moved together within a single poll: five clean 1 → 0 transitions,
each followed by the frequency reading 0.0 Hz two seconds later, and the
matching 0 → 1 transitions with the frequency picking up in the same poll.

**The apparent counterexamples are the important part.** In four further cases
the bit dropped to 0 while the frequency stayed at 20–35 Hz. Every one of them
lines up with the *other* indoor unit still demanding at that moment. That is
the relationship worth remembering:

- `state[9] & 0x02` is **per indoor unit** — does this unit want the compressor.
- Code `0x11` is **outdoor-unit-level** (§5.4) — is the shared compressor
  turning, for whoever asked.

On a single-split system the two are interchangeable. On a multi-split they are
not, and the bit is the one that answers "is this room being served".

`state[7] & 0x10` stayed set in every sample, at 0 Hz and at full load alike,
so whatever it means, it is not compressor state.

### 4.5 Temperatures — prefer the segments over `state[5]`

`state[5]` is `DB3`, the *room temperature the controller is currently working
with*, in the SPI encoding `T = (raw − 61) / 4`, 0.25 °C steps `[EXT]`. It is
populated on a live device — verified against a capture where `state[5] = 0x9A`
⇒ 23.25 °C while the indoor-temperature segment read 23.5 °C `[HW]`. Usable as a
coarse fallback, and useful as a plausibility check.

**The `0xFF` convention runs the other way.** `0xFF` means "no external value" in
the *write* direction (`command[5]`, §5.6); in the read direction the AC reports
the temperature it is actually using.

Which is literal: with an external room temperature injected, `state[5]` carries
back exactly the value that was written, and so does the pushed indoor-temperature
segment below — neither is a reading of the room any more. See §5.6. `[HW]`

The temperature you actually want arrives as **pushed variable segments** (§5.2)
with much better resolution: 256-entry thermistor lookup tables, 0.1 °C steps,
−30…52 °C indoor and −50…43 °C outdoor. These tables are non-linear and are not
derivable from a formula — copy them (the ones in this project live in
[`pywfrac`'s `utils.py`](https://github.com/blues-sechseck/pywfrac/blob/main/src/pywfrac/utils.py)). `[APP]`

## 5. Layer 4 — variable segments: the operation-data channel

This is the part the official app barely uses, and the most valuable part of the
interface.

### 5.1 Segment format

Every variable segment is **4 bytes**, and it is literally `DB9…DB12` of an SPI
frame: `[FW]`

```
[ Code, OP1, OP2, OP3 ]  ==  [ DB9, DB10, DB11, DB12 ]
```

| `OP1` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x10` (16) | status report — this segment carries a value |
| `0xFF` (255) | **request** — "tell me this" |
| `0x00` (0) | **command** — "set this" |

`OP2`/`OP3` are the value, or the sub-selector, depending on the code.

**In a request, all three of `OP1`, `OP2` and `OP3` are `0xFF`.** They are the
answer's fields, not yours: the AC fills them in when it replies. `[EXT]` A
request on the bus carries two things, `DB6` and the code in `DB9` - the
bus-level capture in MHI-AC-Trace shows `ff ff ff` behind them, and one ESPHome
implementation hands its request builder a buffer that ends before `DB10`
altogether. Putting anything else in those three bytes does not add information
to the request, it malforms it: asking with `OP1 = 0x10` here returned a body
that was not even valid UTF-8, and `OP1 = 0x20` got the segment dropped without
an answer. `[HW]`

Which unit an answer came from is read off `OP1` in the **reply**: `& 0x30` is
`0x20` for the indoor sensor and `0x10` for the outdoor one, the same convention
as the air temperatures in §5.2. `[EXT]`

> **Safety note.** `OP1 = 0` writes into the AC main board through a path nobody
> outside MHI has mapped. If you are exploring, send `0xFF` only.

### 5.2 What arrives unsolicited

The bridge keeps a cache of exactly **three** slots, hard-coded in ROM `[FW]`:

| Code | `OP1` | Meaning | Decoding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x80` | `0x10` | outdoor temperature | `outdoorTempTable[OP2]`, 0.1 °C |
| `0x80` | `0x20` | indoor temperature | `indoorTempTable[OP2]`, 0.1 °C |
| `0x94` | `0x10` | energy meter | `(OP3<<8 \| OP2) × 0.25` kWh |

These appear in the RECEIVE block's trailer on ordinary polls, without being
asked for. `[HW]` They are not pushed by the AC of its own accord, though: the
bridge requests them itself, cycling a three-entry ROM table of `(code, unit)`
pairs - `80 01`, `80 00`, `94 01` at `0x3025` - and setting the bus-level unit
selector per entry, `0xc0` for the indoor variant and `0x40` for the outdoor
one. `[FW]` That is why `0x80` arrives twice with different `OP1` values: it is
asked twice. It is also the only place in the firmware where that selector is
set from anything other than a constant - see §5.3.

The energy counter is **per run, not lifetime**: it counts up in 0.25 kWh steps
while the indoor unit is running, holds its last value while the unit is off,
and is cleared to 0 at the next power-on — the value read right after an
off→on transition is 0. `[HW]` (Six resets across two units, each one within a
minute of an off→on transition, including one initiated from the unit itself
rather than over the network; no reset ever occurred without a power-on, and
ordinary `setAirconStat` commands do not clear it.) Treat it as a counter that
may restart at any time: accumulate its upward steps yourself if you want a
lifetime figure, and never read a low value as a fault.

**What the 0.25 kWh resolution costs.** Only completed steps are reported, so
whatever a run consumes above its last completed step never appears in the
counter at all, and the next power-on clears it — a lifetime figure built from
this source is therefore always low. The shortfall is a fixed amount *per run*,
about 0.125 kWh on average, no matter how long the run is `[INF]`: a unit
cycling every half hour totals noticeably low, one running for hours at a time
is off by little. A run consuming less than 0.25 kWh reads 0 throughout and
contributes nothing `[HW]`. There is no finer counter in the protocol — an
external energy meter is the only accurate option for a frequently cycling
unit.

On a multi-split the counter is **per indoor unit**, not a shared outdoor-unit
total, so the values of two units may be summed. `[HW]` (Verified on a
two-unit multi-split: one unit cleared its counter at its own power-on while
the sibling's kept running unchanged; the two accumulated at different rates
over the same interval; and one kept counting while the other was off for
seven hours. Do not conclude the opposite from a single side-by-side run —
two units cooling in parallel accumulate at nearly the same rate and look
like one shared meter.)

### 5.3 Requesting anything else — the generic path

The bridge copies the COMMAND block's variable segments **verbatim and
unfiltered** into a request queue, emits one per MISO frame with the
operation-data type bit set in `DB6`, matches incoming MOSI answers by code
byte, and appends the matches to the RECEIVE block's trailer. `[FW]`

There is no whitelist on this path. The only special case is the *matching*
step: for code `248` the sub-code in `OP2` is compared as well, because that
code alone would not identify which of six answers came back.

**Recipe** — verified end to end on real hardware `[HW]`:

```
1. build a COMMAND block with NO set-bits: all zeros, command[5] = 0xFF,
   command[8] as usual (see below - do not send the current state)
2. trailer = [1] + [code, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]        # one request
3. CRC, base64, POST setAirconStat
4. the answer is ALREADY in that POST's own response:
   receive trailer -> [code, sel, value, value2]
```

**Send an empty command block, not the current state.** The obvious approach —
fill the block from the last status you read — makes the request a full write
of that status, and any change made at the unit since you read it is undone.
It is unnecessary: a value applies only together with its set-bit (§4.3), so a
block with none of them set changes nothing while still carrying the trailer.
Measured on two indoor units `[HW]`: `result: 0`, the complete operation-data
trailer in the response, and power, mode, fan speed, setpoint and both vane
axes unchanged — with the unit running and with it switched off.

Carry `command[8]` as you would in a real command, though. It is the one field
with no set-bit of its own, and dropping it clears the unit's echo of it in
`DB5` bit `0x10` — harmless in itself, but it makes that bit look like a state
change when it is only an echo of your own last frame. `[HW]`

**Read the answer out of the `setAirconStat` response.** The round trip over the
CNS bus finishes inside the HTTP request, so the reply block you get back
already carries the extra segment. It is *transient*: the bridge clears its
response cache after handing it over, and a `getAirconStat` ~2.5 s later shows
the usual three segments and nothing else. `[HW]` If any other client polls the
device in that window, it — not you — gets the answer.

Two things that do **not** work as one might expect `[HW]`:

- **The command-block echo does not reflect your trailer.** It stays at the
  `0xFF` sentinel, so it cannot be used as an "was my request accepted"
  channel. The answer itself is the only confirmation.
- **The only field that steers a request is one you cannot write.** Of the four
  segment bytes only the code reaches the AC as an input. The unit is selected
  in `DB6`, and on the path that carries *your* segments the bridge writes it as
  `(DB6 & 0x3f) | 0x80` - a constant, regardless of what you sent. `[FW]` The
  firmware does know how to set that selector properly, and does so with
  `0xc0`/`0x40` exactly as the CNS implementations do `[EXT]` - but only for the
  three requests of its own in §5.2, driven by a table in flash. There is no
  path from the trailer to it. The reply's own `OP1` says which sensor answered
  (§5.1), but that is the answer's field, not a way to ask.

**Limits.** The bridge does not clamp the segment count and copies `count × 4`
bytes into a queue with room for 22 entries. `[FW]` Keep the count small (1–3);
a large count is a buffer overrun on a device you cannot debug.

**Timing.** SPI frames run at roughly 20/s `[EXT]`, one request per frame, so a
handful of requests resolve in well under a second. Anything slower than that is
your own poll interval, not the device.

### 5.4 Operation-data codes

The bridge firmware contains per-code plausibility rules for these codes `[FW]`.
**All fifteen were requested over the WF-RAC HTTP path and all fifteen
answered** (SRK35ZS-WF, `WF-RAC-HTTPS 025/200`) `[HW]`. Measured twice:
once with the compressor idle, once under load (setpoint forced 6 K below room
temperature). Where a value moved sensibly between the two, that is noted —
those readings are consistent with the MHI-AC-Ctrl formulas `[EXT]`, but two
operating points are not a calibration, so the formulas stay `[INF]`.

| Code | Name | Formula | Measured (compressor idle) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x11` | Compressor frequency [Hz] | `(sel − 0x10) × 25.6 + 0.1 × OP2` | idle `00` ⇒ 0.0 Hz · load `e6` ⇒ **23.0 Hz** |
| `0x90` | Current [A] | `OP2 × 14 / 51` | idle `00` ⇒ 0.0 A · load `04` ⇒ **1.10 A** (≈250 W) |
| `0xB1` | TDSH [°C] | `OP2 / 2` | `00` in both — never moved |
| `0x85` | Discharge pipe TD [°C] | `OP2 / 2 + 32`, **only for `OP2 >= 0x12`** | idle `14` ⇒ 42 °C · load `17` ⇒ **43.5 °C** |
| `0x13` | Outdoor EEV [pulses] | `OP2` | idle `c8` ⇒ 200 · load `5f`/`66` ⇒ **95 / 102** (valve closes under load) |
| `0x05` | Internal setpoint [°C] | `OP2 / 2`, `sel` = `0x13` | `2e` ⇒ **23.0 °C** while 22.5 °C was the value sent |
| `0x82` | THO-R1 | outdoor heat exchanger, **no known conversion** | idle `3f` ⇒ 63 · load `49` ⇒ 73; tracks the outdoor unit, but not on the coil scale below |
| `0x81` | THI-R1 [°C] | thermistor curve, see §5.4 | `20 5a ff` ⇒ raw 90, **`sel` = `0x20`** |
| `0x87` | THI-R3 [°C] | thermistor curve, see §5.4 | `10 5a ff` ⇒ raw 90 |
| `0x1E` | Total run hours [h] | `OP2 × 100` | `ff ff ff` ⇒ **no value** |
| `0x1F` | Indoor fan speed | `OP1 & 0x0f`, **not `OP2`** `[EXT]` | `ff ff ff` ⇒ **no value** |
| `0x0D` | *unknown* | — | `00 ff ff`, `sel` = `0x00` |
| `0x21` | *unknown* | — | `10 ff ff` ⇒ no value |
| `0x32` | *unknown* | — | `2e 04 ff`, unusual `sel` |
| `0x34` | *unknown* | — | `11 01 04`, **uses `OP3`** — multi-byte value |
| `0x35` | *unknown* | — | `10 00 ff` |
| `0x80` | Air temperature | see §5.2 | pushed unsolicited |
| `0x94` | Energy [kWh] | see §5.2 | pushed unsolicited |

Notes on the shape of the answers `[HW]`:

- The second byte is a **selector**, not a fixed status marker. `0x10` and
  `0x20` follow the same indoor/outdoor convention as air temperature; `0x0D`
  and `0x32` answer with values outside that pattern and are not understood.
- **`0x05` is not in the firmware's whitelist and answers anyway**, over the
  generic path (§5.3), with the setpoint the unit is *using internally*. It is
  not always the value that was sent: 22.5 °C came back as 23.0, 22.0 °C as
  22.0 (three and ten measurements, SRK20ZS-WF). The unit resolves whole
  degrees and rounds a half one up, so a half-degree step either lands a full
  degree away or nowhere — which is what `ENHANCED_RESOLUTION` in MHI-AC-Ctrl
  works around. `[HW]` A correction finer than a degree has to travel in the
  injected room temperature instead (§5.6); that field has a 0.25 K grid.
- `0x1E` and `0x1F` answer with all-`0xFF`, and that is as far as this interface
  goes. Both exist on both units, and every implementation that reads them does
  so with `DB6 = 0xc0` for the indoor variant `[EXT]` - the one byte the bridge
  fixes to something else (§5.3). Confirmed by trying: putting `0x10` or `0x20`
  in the request's `OP1` does not stand in for that, it only malforms the
  request (§5.1), while a single-unit code such as `0x11` answers normally in
  the same session. `[HW]` The constant the bridge does send, `0x80`, is what
  those implementations use for "no operating-data request at all" `[EXT]` -
  which is a plausible reason the AC answers codes that exist once and declines
  the two that do not, though that step is inference, not measurement. Either way, reading indoor fan speed
  or run hours needs a device on the indoor unit's own connector; it is not
  available over this interface.
- `0x34` is the only code that used `OP3`, so at least one value here is wider
  than one byte.
- On a multi-split installation, `0x11`/`0x90`/`0x85` (compressor frequency,
  current, discharge temperature) read identically from every indoor unit
  sharing the outdoor unit — they are outdoor-unit-level values, not
  per-indoor. `0x13` (EEV) differs per indoor unit, since each has its own
  expansion valve. Confirmed live: one indoor unit cooling, the other idle,
  identical frequency/current/temperature on both, EEV 57 vs. 0. `[HW]` So
  `0x11` does **not** tell you whether *this* indoor unit is calling for
  cooling on a multi-split — `state[9] & 0x02` (§4.6) does, and costs nothing.
- `0x13`'s full-open pulse count is unknown. MHI-AC-Ctrl reads the same
  quantity as 16 bits (`DB12<<8 | DB11`, its `OU-EEV1`), while this bridge's
  `OP2` is a single byte — likely a narrowed/derived value, not a raw pass
  of the same counter. No reference project (MHI-AC-Ctrl or its ESPHome
  port) converts it to a percentage either; both publish raw pulses. `[EXT]`
  Mapping the byte linearly onto 0–100 % is fine as a *relative* reading —
  idle against load, or one indoor unit against another — but do not present
  it as a calibrated valve opening.
- `0x13` reads 0 on an indoor unit whose compressor is not running, and a
  normal value on an active one at the same moment. `[HW]`
- **`0x85` below `OP2 = 0x12` is not a temperature.** MHI-AC-Trace states the
  conversion as two branches: below that byte the sensor only reports "30 °C or
  colder", above it the value is `OP2 / 2 + 32`. `[EXT]` Applying the second
  branch everywhere turns an idle outdoor unit's bytes 8–16 into a steady
  36–40 °C, which looks like a running crankcase heater and was read as one
  ([#288](https://github.com/blues-sechseck/Mitsubishi-WF-RAC-Integration/issues/288)).
  Confirmed against 24 h of own data: compressor frequency 0 and current 0.00
  throughout, `0x85` between bytes 8 and 15 while outdoor air swung 29.7 → 11.0 °C,
  on an outdoor unit with no crankcase heater. `[HW]` Both of the calibration
  points above sit above the threshold, so the low branch rests on that source
  alone — treat a byte under `0x12` as "no reading", not as a cold pipe.

- **The two indoor coil sensors are per indoor unit; `0x82` is shared.** Over a
  night with one indoor unit cycling and the other cooling continuously, both
  units' `0x81` collapsed when their *own* compressor demand was on, while
  `0x82` read the same on both (paired correlation 0.89). `0x87` follows `0x81`
  per unit: identical while the compressor is off, higher while it runs — the
  difference is evaporator superheat. `[HW]`
- **Conversion for `0x81`/`0x87` — invert the divider, do not index a table:**

      byte = G · Rs / (Rs + R(T)),   R(T) = R25 · exp(B · (1/T − 1/298.15))
      R25 = 5200 Ω,  B = 3900 K,  G = 367,  Rs = 1912 Ω

  MHI's service manuals print **one** characteristic for room air, indoor coil,
  outdoor coil and outdoor air, and the sensor is a ~5 kΩ NTC with B ≈ 3950
  `[EXT]`. The channels differ only in their series resistor, which is why the
  app's two air tables (§5.2) map onto each other by a fractional-linear
  relation rather than an offset — and why no indexing of either table ever fit
  the coil. With the outdoor and indoor channels' own resistors (≈5.6 kΩ and
  ≈4.0 kΩ) the same formula reproduces both published tables to ~0.3 K, so only
  `Rs` is specific to the coil. `[INF]`
- **`Rs` measured, not assumed.** Four infrared readings during one heating run
  plus a standstill reading against a room thermometer, RMS 0.25 K over
  23–46 °C. `[HW]` The infrared thermometer sees a mix of fin and intake air,
  so the fin's share is a free parameter of the fit — and it is what settles
  the question: one constant share explains all four readings on this curve,
  while `outdoorTempList[2 × OP2]` extended upward would need that share to
  halve between cooling and heating. Sample values: byte 47 → 5.5 °C,
  75 → 17.0, 129 → 34.1, 170 → 45.8, 186 → 50.4, 252 → 72.1. `[HW]`
  Measure on **matt tape stuck to the fins**: bare aluminium has an emissivity
  near 0.35 and reads several kelvin too high in cooling, low in heating.
- **Two caveats.** Above byte 170 the curve is extrapolation — physically
  motivated, but no thermometer has been held against it, and byte 252 (seen on
  a 36 °C day) would put the coil at 72 °C, past the 63 °C heating overload
  cut-out that did not trigger. And at the cold end the curve reads ~5.5 °C
  where the manual's frost protection cuts out at 1.0 °C; that threshold is
  adjustable on the unit and what gets sampled is the value *before* the stop,
  so a direct reading at byte 75 (16.8 °C measured, 17.0 °C from the curve) was
  taken as the better evidence. `[HW]` `[INF]`
- **`0x82` is the same sensor behind a different resistor.** MHI's diagram
  covers the outdoor coil too, and a five-hour standstill puts it on
  `Rs ≈ 1230 Ω` against a reference thermometer — the same channel type as the
  indoor coil (both far below the air channels' 4.0/5.6 kΩ, as a sensor that
  has to span frost to condensing temperature needs), but not the same value:
  at byte 80 the two curves are 4.5 K apart. `[HW]` `[INF]` Readings taken in
  afternoon sun run high on a west-facing unit, and no calibrated point exists
  yet, so it stays a raw byte. A defrost cycle would anchor it exactly: the
  outdoor coil sits at 0 °C while ice melts off it.
- `0x82` is *not* on that scale — a resting outdoor coil reads far lower than a
  resting indoor coil at the same temperature. MHI-AC-Ctrl documents no formula
  for THO-R1 either. `[EXT]` Treat it as a raw byte.
- **Not every firmware branch answers usefully.** On `mcu131`/`wireless010`,
  `0x11` and `0x90` (compressor frequency, operating current) have been
  reported to return a constant 0 even with the compressor confirmed running,
  while `0x85` and `0x13` return real, unit-specific values on those same
  units. `[EXT]` Both formulas produce exactly `0.0` for `OP1 = 0x10,
  OP2 = 0`, so a decoded zero cannot be told apart from a genuine one — keep
  the raw bytes if you need to distinguish "no data" from "not running".

Codes that MHI-AC-Ctrl uses but that are **absent** from the bridge's list, and
therefore doubtful over this path: `0x7C` (protection number), `0x0C` (defrost).
`[FW]` `0x7C` is now requested alongside the rest, as `Protection Number (raw)`
— it sits in the same operation-data address space, and a code the module does
not serve simply leaves its value empty, which costs nothing. It does answer,
confirmed on three units across single- and multi-split `[HW]`, but it only
ever reads `0`: a controlled test that reproduced a real overload clamp (see
§5.7) left it unmoved. Read together with the stop-code table
(`error_codes.py`), which describes its non-zero values as escalated faults or
stops rather than the speed-limit clamps in §5.7, the code appears to track
protective *stops* only — it is not a general-purpose "unit is protecting
itself" flag. `0x0C` is not requested.

### 5.5 Code `248` — the one the app does use

The official app's only use of the request channel is the "auto-heating /
away-mode" settings screen. `[APP]`

| Sub-code (`OP2`) | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 27 / 28 | outdoor-temperature rule, cooling / heating |
| 29 / 30 | target room temperature, cooling / heating |
| 31 / 32 | airflow, cooling / heating |

- read: send `[248, 0xFF, sub, 0x00]` — six segments, one per sub-code
- write: send `[248, 0x00, sub, value]`
- answers come back as `[248, 0x10, sub, value]`
- temperatures are `value / 2` °C, exactly like the setpoint
- airflow raw bytes map `(0, 3, 5, 7, 14) → auto, 1, 2, 3, 4`

Verified end to end against real hardware, including a write round-trip. `[HW]`
That makes it the working reference implementation for §5.3: same mechanism,
different code byte.

### 5.6 Injecting an external room temperature

`command[5]` reaches the bus as `DB3`. Writing a value below `0xFF` makes the AC
use it **instead of** its built-in sensor `[EXT]`; the encoding is
`raw = round(T × 4) + 61`.

The official app never writes this byte — it is fixed at `0xFF`. `[APP]` The
path is open on the WF-RAC interface `[FW]`, and it works: **verified on an
SRK20ZS-WF** (`WF-RAC-HTTPS` 025/200) in cooling `[HW]`. It is a real control
command, not a query. This is the single most requested reason for replacing the
module with an ESP32, and it does not require replacing anything.

**Both read paths follow the injected value.** 18.0 °C written into `command[5]`
came back one poll cycle later as `state[5] = 0x85` — exactly the byte written —
and as 18.5 °C in the pushed indoor-temperature segment (§5.2), while the room
was at 21.2 °C. Writing `0xFF` again restored the real reading within one cycle,
to 0.05 K of its previous value. So while an override stands, **nothing on the
wire still reports the unit's own sensor**: a client that wants the room
temperature has to keep its own source.

The 0.5 K between the two is not something the AC adds to injected values. The
same gap sits between `state[5]` and the pushed segment in every reading with no
override in sight (22.50/23.0, 22.25/22.7, 20.75/21.2) — `state[5]` steps in
0.25 K, the pushed segment comes from the 0.1 K table of §5.2. One source, two
resolutions.

The value has no set-bit of its own (§4.3), so it is written by whichever frame
goes out next and reverted by any frame that leaves the byte at `0xFF` — there is
no way to write it once and leave it. A periodic request frame is the cheapest
carrier for it; note that this makes such a frame a write, and that a running
self-clean cycle does not survive one `[HW]`.

### 5.7 Compressor overload protection (speed-limit clamps)

Separate from the stop codes in §4.4/`error_codes.py`, and from `Protection
Number (raw)` in §5.4: this control never stops the compressor or reports a
code, it only raises its **lower** speed limit for as long as the trigger
condition holds. A controlled test — an outdoor unit's air-temperature sensor
heated past the documented cooling threshold — reproduced the expected
speed-floor rise while `Protection Number (raw)` stayed `0` throughout,
confirming the code does not cover it `[HW]`. The only outside signal is the
effect itself, on the Compressor Frequency sensor: the reading holds at or
above the floor instead of modulating down.

The mechanism is documented in the SRK service manuals for each indoor series,
keyed to outdoor air temperature with per-step hysteresis, and the numbers
differ by series and — within a series — by indoor unit size `[EXT]`:

| Series | Step (outdoor air) | Resets below | Lower limit, SRK20-35 | Lower limit, SRK50 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZS-WF, ZT-WF | ≥ 41 °C | 40 °C | 30 rps | 27 rps |
| ZS-WF, ZT-WF | ≥ 47 °C | 46 °C | 45 rps | 35 rps |
| ZSX-WF, ZR-WF | ≥ 38 °C | 37 °C | 25 rps | — |
| ZSX-WF, ZR-WF | ≥ 41 °C | 40 °C | 30 rps | — |
| ZSX-WF, ZR-WF | ≥ 47 °C | 46 °C | 40 rps | — |

(`—`: not yet transcribed for SRK50/60 on the ZSX-WF/ZR-WF side.)

Heating has its own, separate table with more steps, and starts from a
noticeably lower outdoor temperature per series — 22 °C for ZS-WF against
17 °C (indoor fan) / 13 °C (outdoor unit) for ZSX-WF `[EXT]` — but the exact
speed floors for that direction have not been transcribed here yet.

**Deliberately not a sensor.** A client cannot tell from the wire which of
these rows applies — the protocol carries a capability group, not the SRK
series or size class `[FW]` `[INF]` — so an automatic binary sensor built on
outdoor temperature would have to ask the user to pick their model and trust
the answer, silently wrong for anyone who picks the wrong line. Multi-split
adds a third case on top: the outdoor unit runs its own overload control there,
so even a correctly-picked indoor table does not necessarily govern.

Where the series and size are known, a plain template sensor with hysteresis
on the raw outdoor-temperature entity, comparing against the relevant row,
covers this without needing it built in.

## 6. What you cannot get, and why

### 6.1 Set-bits are filtered out

Before handing the state block to the network side, the bridge masks it with an
18-byte ROM table. `[FW]` The mask is

```
00 00 A2 88 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 0A 00 00 00 00 00
```

and the bits it clears are precisely the MISO set-bits of §4.3 —
`DB0` bits 7/5/1, `DB1` bits 7/3, `DB2` bit 7 (plus two bits in `state[11]` and
`state[12]`). You cannot see which field was last written, over any API.

*(This mask is also the independent proof of the whole §4 mapping: an 18-byte
table whose set bits land exactly on the documented SPI set-bits cannot be a
coincidence.)*

### 6.2 `DB8`–`DB14` never leave the module

The state block takes MOSI bytes 1–10 and 20–27; bytes 11–19 are dropped. `[FW]`
That includes `DB13`, the byte whose bits are believed to carry outdoor-unit
status including compressor running/idle `[EXT]`.

That is a real limit, but it does **not** mean compressor state is unreachable:
it also rides in `DB7` bit 1, which *is* forwarded — see §4.6. Do not
generalise "`DB13` is dropped" into "outdoor status is unavailable"; check the
forwarded bytes first.

### 6.3 `autoHeating` / `highTemp` / `lowTemp` are not what they look like

These three are carried in the **UART frame header** between the Realtek and the
RL78, not in the `airconStat` blob, and surface as top-level JSON fields. `[FW]`

Measured across four devices, three accounts and two firmware branches:
`highTemp` and `lowTemp` come back as the constants `"AB"` and `"66"`, and
`autoHeating` is always `0`. `[HW]` The official app never writes the local
request fields either (they stay `null`); the only code that sets a
`highTemp`/`lowTemp` pair does so on a **cloud** endpoint. `[APP]`

Treat them as inert unless you can prove otherwise on your unit.

### 6.4 Self-clean cannot be started remotely

No code path in the app sends "start self-clean"; only a reset/cancel bit exists
(`command[10]` bit `0x04`). `[APP]` The status bit `state[15] & 0x01` does **not**
track the real cycle: driven from the IR remote, it stayed `0` through a
complete self-clean run while the module was polled throughout. `[HW]` It echoes
the last value written over Wi-Fi, nothing more.

### 6.5 The cloud adds no data

The MQTT reporter and the local `getAirconStat` handler call the *same* builder
for the `contents` object; the only difference is that the MQTT report appends
`aggTm`. `[FW]` The cloud's hourly/daily/monthly "operation data" is a
server-side aggregation of exactly what you can read locally. `[APP]`

### 6.6 The hourly reset is not the module's idea

The module resets its CPU from exactly two places: a one-shot 10 s timer used
after provisioning, and a `module_reset()` whose only caller is the branch that
handles "cpu reset received" — a bit in an incoming frame from the bridge.
Every timer in the module firmware is in the seconds range; no hour-scale
constant exists in the application area. `[FW]` So the periodic reset seen in
the field is commanded from below, not by the Wi-Fi stack. Blocking the module's
WAN access does not stop it. `[HW]`

### 6.7 Left/right vanes and 3D-auto, on units with the legacy bus signature

The bridge MCU implements **two** CNS protocols and picks one from the first
MOSI signature byte the indoor unit sends. `[FW]` The choice is made once per
frame and switches the whole receive/transmit path, not a single branch:

| MOSI `SB0` | MISO `SB0` | Frame builder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0xC7` | `0x9B` | `0x5C7F` |
| `0x6C` | `0xA9` | `0x54B7` |
| anything else | `0xAA` | `0x54B7` |

`0x6C` with a `0xA9` MISO signature is the classic MHI bus as documented by
MHI-AC-Trace. `[EXT]` And on exactly that path, after the §6.1 mask is applied,
the module overwrites the byte unconditionally: `[FW]`

```
if (MOSI[0] == 0x6C) state[12] = 1;
```

So on a legacy-signature unit `state[12]` is **not a device state at all**. It
is always `1`, whatever raw byte 22 contained, which means:

- `(state[12] & 0x03) == 1` always holds → the left/right vane position in
  `state[11]` is never reported. A client following §4.2 will read "auto"
  forever, no matter what position the unit is actually in.
- `(state[12] & 0x0C) == 0x04` can never hold → `Entrust` (3D auto) always
  reads as off.

Writing still works — the command path is untouched. Only the read-back is
gone, so a client must not confirm a horizontal-vane command by re-reading it.

**How to tell which kind of unit you have:** `SB0` itself is not visible over
the network, so test the symptom. Any reading of `state[12]` other than `1`
proves the extended variant — the reference unit for this document reports
`0x00` throughout `[HW]`. If it does read `1`, move the horizontal vane from
the infrared remote and poll again: on the extended variant `state[12]` and the
position in `state[11]` follow, on the legacy one `state[12]` stays `1`.

Do **not** use the app's per-model capability tables to decide this. Their
`windDirectionLR` flag is set for four of the five model classes `[APP]`, which
says what the model line supports, not what this bus variant reports back.

## 7. Worked flows

### 7.1 Read state

```
POST /beaver/command/getDeviceInfo          -> airconId
POST /beaver/command/getAirconStat {airconId}
  -> contents.airconStat (base64)
     decode, skip COMMAND block (§3.1), parse 18 state bytes (§4.2)
     parse trailer segments (§5.2) for temperatures and kWh
```

### 7.2 Change the setpoint to 22.0 °C

```
1. read current state (7.1)                     # you must send a full state
2. command = current 18 bytes re-encoded
3. command[4] = int(22.0 * 2) | 0x80            # value + set-bit
4. trailer  = [0x01, 0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF]       # sentinel
5. blob = crc16(command + trailer) + crc16(receive + trailer)
6. POST setAirconStat {airconId, airconStat: base64(blob)}
```

Registering your `operatorId` via `updateAccountInfo` is a prerequisite (§2.5).

### 7.3 Ask for compressor frequency

```
1. build a no-op command block (current state, no set-bits)
2. trailer = [0x01, 0x11, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]
3. POST setAirconStat
4. sleep 1 s
5. POST getAirconStat, scan the RECEIVE trailer for a segment whose code is 0x11
   -> Hz = (OP1 - 0x10) * 25.6 + 0.1 * OP2
```

Untested `[INF]`. If it works, the same shape works for every code in §5.4.

## 8. Firmware versions

Three parallel version lines exist. **Version numbers are only comparable within
one `firmType`** — a higher number in another branch means nothing. This trips
people up constantly when comparing notes across units.

| `firmType` | Wireless (`M`) | MCU (`C`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WF-RAC` | 010 | 131 |
| `WF-RAC-HTTPS` | 025 | 200 |
| `WCBN4612L` | 029 | 999 |

Both numbers are reported by `getDeviceInfo` as `wireless`/`mcu`, alongside
`firmType`. Quote all three when reporting a problem — the pair alone is
ambiguous.

Updating is the app's job and is deliberately **not** documented here. Two
things are worth knowing before anyone goes looking:

- The bridge MCU update path is **fire and forget** — no progress reporting, no
  rollback, no second bank. A failed write does not leave you with a device to
  retry on.
- The device rejects downgrades: if the requested version is not newer than the
  running one, the handler returns `200 OK` and does nothing. `[FW]`

## 9. Quick answers to the usual questions

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can I run an ESP32 on CNS *and* keep the WF-RAC module? | No. Two active slaves on the bus conflict. A purely passive sniffer that never drives MISO is fine. `[EXT]` |
| Is there a local MQTT broker? | No. MQTT is cloud-only, endpoint fetched from `iot.smartmair.com`, mutual TLS with a device certificate in flash. `[FW]` |
| Can I get compressor/current/hours without opening the unit? | Yes, via §5.3 — verified end to end, all fifteen codes in §5.4 answer. Watch the firmware caveat there. |
| Can I feed an external room temperature without opening the unit? | Yes, via §5.6, verified on hardware. It also replaces the room temperature the unit reports back. |
| Does the module do anything smart with the state bytes? | No. It is a base64 pipe. All semantics live in the RL78 and the AC. `[FW]` |
| Why does the energy counter keep dropping to zero? | It is a per-run counter, not a lifetime one (§5.2). Nothing is broken. |
| Why is my accumulated energy total lower than my electricity meter? | The counter reports whole 0.25 kWh steps only, and each power-on discards the unreported remainder — about 0.125 kWh per run (§5.2). |
| How do I tell "unit is on" from "compressor is actually running"? | `state[9] & 0x02` (§4.6), free in every poll. On a multi-split it answers per indoor unit, unlike compressor frequency. |
| Why does my client work on one unit and fail on another? | Almost always `airconId` missing (§2.5), TLS too modern (§2.2), or the four account slots being full. |
| Why do my commands get refused right after someone used the app? | The 60-second write lock (§2.7). Wait for `expires` and send again. |
| Why can nobody else control the unit while my client runs? | Same lock, from the other side: you are renewing it. Anything you send on a cadence — a status request for operation data included — has to leave it lapse. |

## Appendix A — bridge MCU internals (provenance)

Only needed if you want to re-derive or extend the above. Architecture: Renesas
RL78, 64 KiB image, unencrypted, ~36 KiB occupied. Confirmed with a real
`rl78-elf-objdump` built from GNU binutils. Addresses are RAM in the `0xF____`
segment.

| Address | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `0xE236` | 18-byte COMMAND state, as received from the Wi-Fi side |
| `0xE248` | COMMAND segment count; segments from `0xE249` |
| `0xE1DE` | request queue, count in `0xFE3B6`, room for 22 segments |
| `0xE186` | response cache, count in `0xFE3B9`, 22 segments |
| `0xE17A` | unsolicited-push cache, 3 slots; ROM table at `0x3025` = `80 01`, `80 00`, `94 01` |
| `0xE2F5` | 18-byte RECEIVE state (what §4 calls `state[0..17]`) |
| `0xE307` | RECEIVE segment count; segments from `0xE308` |
| `0xE3BA` | raw 18 bytes lifted out of the MOSI stream, pre-mask |
| `0xE3CF` | MOSI frame, 33 bytes (`SB0` at +0, `DB0` at +3, `DB9..DB12` = `0xE3DB..0xE3DE`) |
| `0xE3F0` | live MOSI receive buffer, 33 bytes; `0x52DB` promotes it into `0xE3CF` |
| `0xE411` | MISO frame (`DB6` = `0xE41A`, `DB9..DB12` = `0xE41D..0xE420`) |
| `0xE3B7` | request state machine, 0…5 |
| `0x3034` | 18-byte ROM mask (§6.1) |

| Function | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `0x9B28` | unpack COMMAND block from the Wi-Fi buffer (`0xDE85`), verify CRC16 |
| `0x6AB7` | fill the request queue from `0xE248`/`0xE249`; state 1→2 |
| `0x5679` | emit one queued segment per MISO frame into `DB9..DB12`, set the opdata bit in `DB6`; when drained, state→3 |
| `0x53BB` | copy MOSI frame → raw state `0xE3BA`, then call the two below |
| `0x58B1` | handle one received segment: push-cache check, then match against the request queue; all matched ⇒ state 4 |
| `0x5B27` | build the RECEIVE trailer from push cache + response cache |
| `0x680F` | build the RECEIVE state: `state[i] = raw[i] & ~mask[i]`, then force `state[12] = 1` on the legacy signature (§6.7) |
| `0x58A2` | pick the MISO signature byte from the MOSI one — the protocol-variant switch (§6.7) |
| `0x5C7F` | the other frame builder, used on the `0xC7` variant |
| `0x9A44` | pack RECEIVE state + trailer + CRC16 into the Wi-Fi buffer |
| `0x54B7` | translate the COMMAND state into a MISO frame (`command[i] → MISO byte i+1`), legacy variant |

The Realtek module image was worked through with a Capstone Thumb-2 pass.

**Do not flash the bridge MCU.** The update path has no rollback, no progress
reporting and no second bank, and the official app does not even offer the file.

## Appendix B — sources

| Source | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `WCBN4612L_M_029.bin` (unencrypted Realtek image, log macros keep file names, line numbers and function names in clear text) | HTTP handlers, MQTT, reset paths, rate limiting, `airconId`/`operatorId` validation |
| `WF-RAC-HTTPS_C_200.bin` (64 KiB RL78 image) | everything in §4, §5, §6.1, §6.2, Appendix A |
| Smart M-Air Android app 1.4.009 | blob layout, CRC, code `248`, capabilities, thermistor tables |
| [MHI-AC-Trace `SPI.md`](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Trace/blob/main/SPI.md), [MHI-AC-Ctrl](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl) | SPI frame layout, set-bit semantics, operation-data codes and formulas |
| Live captures against SRK35ZS-WF units on `WF-RAC-HTTPS 025/200` | every `[HW]` claim |

**On the reach of the `[FW]` claims about the module.** They all come from that
one `WCBN4612L` image, because it is the only module firmware published in the
clear — the `WF-RAC` and `WF-RAC-HTTPS` branches ship theirs encrypted end to
end (uniform 8.00 bits/byte, no readable region anywhere in either file). So
none of it can be re-derived on another branch by reading, only confirmed by
observation. Where a `[FW]` claim about the module carries an `[HW]` claim
beside it, that observation was made on `WF-RAC-HTTPS 025/200` and the two
branches agreed.

Independent client implementations worth reading: `homebridge-mhi-wfrac`,
`mqtt2mhi-wf-rac`, `ioBroker.woso_mitsu_aircon_rac`, `node-red-aircon-rac-wf`,
