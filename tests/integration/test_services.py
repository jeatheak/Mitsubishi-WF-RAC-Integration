"""Tests for where the entity service actions and the options reload live.

Both used to sit somewhere else: the actions were registered by the climate
and sensor platforms, and an entry update listener did the reload after an
options change. HA deprecated the second of those in combination with the
config flow's own reloading methods (which this integration uses), so the
options flow now reloads itself - and the actions moved along, so they no
longer depend on a platform having come up.
