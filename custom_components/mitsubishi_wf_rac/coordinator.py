# Commands issued within this window of each other (from any entity) are

# near-simultaneous separate commands can otherwise overwrite each other
# instead of merging (e.g. a fan-speed change followed shortly by a
# temperature change loses the fan change).
UPDATE_CONSOLIDATION_PERIOD = timedelta(milliseconds=500)

# The manufacturer's getFirmware endpoint is unauthenticated and cheap, but
# there's no reason to call it on every MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES (60s) poll -
# firmware doesn't change that often. Rate-limit background checks to this
# interval instead.
FIRMWARE_CHECK_INTERVAL = timedelta(hours=24)

# Operation data is requested for active operation-data entities and costs a
# second request per poll. It stays on the local network and changes nothing on
# the unit (see RacParser.status_request_to_byte) - but it is a setAirconStat,
# so it takes the module's 60-second write lock all the same, and while we hold
# that lock no one else can control the unit at all.
#
# The lock's deadline is `now + 60`, where `now` is the `timestamp` field of
# the request that took it - the module has no RTC and reads its clock from
# whatever the asking client stamps (see _async_write_lock_delay). Stamping the
# request SERVICE_DATA_STAMP_BACKDATE in the past therefore makes it take a lock
# that expires SERVICE_DATA_STAMP_BACKDATE sooner: at 55s back the lock runs 5
# of its 60 seconds, leaving the other 55 of every poll free for the app or the
# IR remote to get a write in. That is what keeps an enabled operation-data
# entity from locking the Smart M-Air app out for good (#294) while still asking
# on every poll. Confirmed against a real module. Detecting the other client
# cannot substitute for the free window:
# a refused write changes nothing the module reports back, so a client we never
# let through is a client we never see (see _detect_foreign_activity).
SERVICE_DATA_REQUEST_INTERVAL = MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES

# How far into the past the operation-data request is stamped, and so how much
# of the 60s lock it gives up. Nearly all of it, because the freed window is
# not how long the app stays usable - one write getting through is enough to
# trigger FOREIGN_ACTIVITY_BACKOFF, which then hands the unit over for minutes.
# It only decides how long someone waits for their *first* tap to land. Half
# the lock made that a coin flip per attempt (#294); a 5s grip per minute makes
# it land first try almost every time. Not the full 60s: the stamp is whole
# seconds and the deadline is compared as timestamp >= expires, so a little
# margin keeps the request holding a lock it can call its own rather than one
# that has already lapsed as it arrives. NOT applied right after one of our own
# real commands - see _async_request_service_data, where backdating would cut
# that command's own protection window instead of someone else's lock (same
# deviceId bypasses the lock check, so the request overwrites our own lease).
# That guard matters more at this setting than it did at 30s: a request that
# slipped past it would leave the command 5 seconds of protection, not 30.
SERVICE_DATA_STAMP_BACKDATE = timedelta(seconds=55)

# A guard against a second request landing in the same poll, not a skip of
# alternate polls (the backdate above is what frees the window now). Kept below
# one poll interval so every poll still asks, but far enough under it that a
# poll answering a few milliseconds faster than the one before it - polls are
# stamped when they finish, not when they were due - does not read as too soon
# and drop the cycle.

# The segment an armed external temperature override subscribes to on its own
# behalf (see _sync_external_temperature_carrier). Any code would do - what
# matters is that a request goes out at all, since that is the frame the
# override rides on - so this is the one that answers under every condition:
# it is per indoor unit and reads a temperature whatever the system is doing,
# which is why it is also the sensor the README recommends enabling first.

# ...but it does matter *where* in the cycle it lands. Issued straight off the
# back of a poll it reached the module about a second after the getAirconStat
# (consolidation delay plus the minimum spacing between requests), and modules
# answer a second request that soon with HTTP 501 "Not supported this command"
# often enough to lose whole cycles of operation data - roughly one poll in
# seven on an affected unit, sometimes several minutes in a row. Offsetting it
# into the quiet middle of the cycle keeps the cadence but stops it from
# crowding the poll. Measured against the poll interval, not the request
# interval: what has to stay clear is the poll, and the polls in between are
# just as much in the way as the one the request was scheduled from.

# covers a typical app session. The operation-data sensors hold their last
# values throughout - a pause we chose is not the stale-data case

        `expires` than the previous poll saw means a write happened in
        between - ours if we sent one, somebody else's if we did not. That is
        the whole detector: no extra request, and no dependence on the

        `updatedBy` cannot do this job. It reports the literal "local" for
